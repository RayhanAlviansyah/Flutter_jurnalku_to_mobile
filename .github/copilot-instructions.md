<!-- Copilot / AI agent instructions for the 'projek_jurnalku_to_mobile' Flutter app -->

# Quick Context
- This repository is a multi-platform Flutter app (mobile/web/desktop) scaffolded by Flutter.
- Key platforms: `android/` (Kotlin DSL: `build.gradle.kts`), `ios/`, `linux/`, `macos/`, `windows/`, and `web/`.
- UI code lives under `lib/` (e.g. `lib/jurnal_Pembiasaan.dart`, `lib/main.dart`). Strings and identifiers are largely in Indonesian — preserve language/context.

# What an AI coding agent should know first
- Primary dependencies are listed in `pubspec.yaml` (notably: `intl`, `google_fonts`). Update `pubspec.yaml` when adding packages or assets.
- Assets are referenced under `assets/images/` (example: `assets/images/profile_2.jpg` used in `lib/jurnal_Pembiasaan.dart`). Any new image must be added to `pubspec.yaml` under `flutter: assets:`.
- This codebase favors small helper widget functions inside widgets (see `kebiasaan()`, `hari()`, `poinCell()` in `lib/jurnal_Pembiasaan.dart`). Follow that pattern when adding similar UI helpers.
- There is no centralized state-management package (e.g., Provider, Bloc). Most current UI is static; when adding stateful behavior, prefer small `StatefulWidget`s or clearly document introducing a state-management dependency.

# Build / Test / Debug (commands you will use)
- Install & fetch packages: `flutter pub get`
- Static analysis: `flutter analyze`
- Run unit/widget tests: `flutter test` (there is `test/widget_test.dart`)
- Run locally (choose device): `flutter run -d <device>` or target the entry: `flutter run -t lib/main.dart`
- Build APK (Android release): `flutter build apk --release`
- Build for iOS: `flutter build ios` (requires macOS and Xcode)
- Web: `flutter run -d chrome` or `flutter build web`
- Windows desktop: `flutter run -d windows` / `flutter build windows`

Note: On Windows PowerShell, chain commands with `;` (e.g. `flutter pub get; flutter analyze`).

# Project-specific patterns and tips
- File naming: Dart files under `lib/` mostly use snake_case, but some filenames contain PascalCase (`jurnal_Pembiasaan.dart`). Match local naming when adding files.
- UI composition: many screens are implemented as a single `StatelessWidget` with many small widget-returning helper methods. Keep the same style when editing that file to minimize diffs.
- Generated code and platform artifacts: do not edit files in `build/`, `ios/Flutter/`, `android/gradle/`, or platform `ephemeral/` folders. These are regenerated by Flutter.
- Gradle uses Kotlin DSL: be aware of `.kts` files in `android/` and `android/app/` when adjusting Android build settings.

# Integration points to watch
- Platform plugin registration happens in platform folders (e.g., `windows/flutter/generated_plugin_registrant.cc`, `linux/flutter/generated_plugin_registrant.cc`, `macos/Flutter/GeneratedPluginRegistrant.swift`). Avoid editing generated registrants.
- No obvious remote backend or API client in the repo. If adding network code, include new dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` and document expected endpoints/config.

# When changing assets, code, or dependencies
- If adding images/fonts: update `pubspec.yaml` `flutter:` section and run `flutter pub get`.
- If introducing new dependencies: add to `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get`. Prefer minimal dependency additions and document the reason in PR description.

# Useful file references (examples you can open)
- `pubspec.yaml` — dependencies, assets
- `lib/main.dart` — app entry point
- `lib/jurnal_Pembiasaan.dart` — representative UI file with helper widgets and Indonesian text
- `test/widget_test.dart` — example widget test
- `android/build.gradle.kts`, `android/app/build.gradle.kts` — Android build config

# PR & commit guidance for AI agents
- Keep changes small and focused; follow existing UI patterns (helper methods inside widget classes).
- Update `pubspec.yaml` in the same commit when adding packages or assets.
- Avoid changes to generated platform code and `build/` outputs.

# If something is unclear
- Ask for clarifications about expected language (Indonesian vs English) and whether state-management libraries are allowed.
- If a build requires platform credentials (e.g., iOS code signing, Android keystore), note that you cannot provide them and document required steps instead.

If you want, I can: (1) run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` now, (2) open a PR draft with this file, or (3) expand guidance sections with examples. Which would you like next?
